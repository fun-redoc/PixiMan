## PixiMan 

ment to be a simple PacMan clone.

I only want to try some functional design ideas.


## Dependecies

- requirejs for modularization
- pixijs for fast rendering in browser (my favourite)

## TODO

- move the man smoothly
- bind eventQueue to the loop function
- move the ghosts
- register collisions ghost man
- game over when man hit ghost
- coins to collect
- game won when all coins collected and not hit by ghost
- sound when collecting coins
- sad sound when hit by ghost
- sound when whon
- background music
- more levels
- random level generator
